CORS Header Scrutiny Filter
===========================

This project provides a CORS ([Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)) HTTP servlet filter to guard against XSRF ([Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29)).
The approach taken here is based on [CORS Origin Header Scrutiny (OWASP)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CORS_OriginHeaderScrutiny).

How It Works
============

The `CorsHeaderScrutinyServletFilter` inspects the HTTP headers to guard against XSRF.  The following HTTP headers are scrutinized:

* Host
* X-Forwarded-Host
* Origin
* Referer

If provided, the hostname of the Origin and Referer headers must match the hostname provided in the X-Forwarded-Host and Host headers.
This ensures that JavaScript invoking HTTP requests must originate from the same host as the web application.

The approach taken here differs from the [OWASP Countermeasure option B](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29) by requiring zero configuration, i.e. there is no need to provide a list of allowed hosts. 

How to Use
==========

Add the dependency to your pom.xml:

````
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.tasktop</groupId>
      <artifactId>cors-servlet-filter</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
````

In the web.xml of your Java web application:

````
	<filter>
		<filter-name>CORSFilter</filter-name>
		<filter-class>com.tasktop.servlet.cors.CorsHeaderScrutinyServletFilter</filter-class>
	</filter>
	<filter-mapping>
		<filter-name>CORSFilter</filter-name>
		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
	</filter-mapping>
````

This filter should be added at the top of the web.xml so that it is invoked before other filters.

Building
========

From the command-line:

`mvn clean package`

Build status on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Tasktop/cors-servlet-filter): ![CI status](https://travis-ci.org/Tasktop/cors-servlet-filter.svg?branch=master "CI Status") 

How To Release
--------------

From the command-line:

````
mvn -Possrh -Psign -DpushChanges=false -DlocalCheckout=true '-Darguments=-Dgpg.passphrase=thesecret -Dgpg.keyname=keyname' release:clean release:prepare
mvn -Possrh -Psign -DpushChanges=false -DlocalCheckout=true '-Darguments=-Dgpg.passphrase=thesecret -Dgpg.keyname=keyname' release:perform
````

Then push changes:

````
git push
````
